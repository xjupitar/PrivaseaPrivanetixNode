### Some Tips choosing the right VPS server: 
Device performance impacts your PoW rewards. Rewards are calculated using the following formula:
<p align="center">â€‹Points = Weight Coefficient x Uptime Percentage</p>

Tasks are completed randomly and during that time if you node failed to complete the task, your node will be considered as Level 4 even though your node meets the Level 1,2, or 3 configuration. So Make sure you choose a stable server such as 'Hetzner' during purchasing any VPS.
